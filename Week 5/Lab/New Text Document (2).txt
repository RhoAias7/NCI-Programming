Having just started college, Bob has been busy looking for a part-time job to fund his new college social life and after only two weeks of looking he has managed to get two job offers!  Each job comes with different hours, basic rates of pay and over-time rates so he needs to work out which would get him the most money. 

Develop an application that would allow Bob to enter his basic pay rate, his number of basic hours work per week and his number of overtime hours per week.  The application should then calculate and display Bobs basic pay for the week, his overtime pay for the week and his total pay including overtime. 

Input:

basicPayRate
noOfBasicHoursWorkPerWeek
noOfOvertimeHours

Process:

Output:
basicPayForTheWeek
overtimePayForTheWeek
